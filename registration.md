## Registration

If you are an early career faculty member, or national lab researcher in an equivalent position at a US institution working in or around the area of combustion and feel you should be invited, [please apply for consideration](https://kyleniemeyer.typeform.com/to/NYlYgV).

Participants will receive travel funds to cover one hotel night and 1.5 days of meals.
In addition, applications from non-R1, primarily undergraduate, and/or minority-serving
institutions will be eligible for an additional $300 travel grant to help ensure a
diverse set of participants. Details about applying for this additional funding can
be found in the online application.

**Note**: Since the workshop is funded by an NSF award, it is open to people from US institutions only.
Participants do not need to be US citizens, but should be employed at a US-based university
or national laboratory.

### Travel reimbursement

At the completion of the workshop, please fill out the following forms for your travel reimbursement. Both forms are required and should be returned, with a scan of your hotel receipt for Saturday night, to Annette Brown (<amb52@psu.edu>). Please contact Jacqueline O'Connor (<jxo22@psu.edu>) and Annette Brown with any questions.
